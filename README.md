# Flower-Classification-CNN
Training Flower Dataset using CNN

We will do the following steps in order:

Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision
Define a Convolutional Neural Network - This is basic CNN
Define a loss function
Train the network on the training data
Test the network on the test data
