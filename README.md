# Flower-Classification-CNN
Using Pytorch to classify Flowers

There are many types of flowers in the world and mostly botanist scientists will need to require some knowledge to able to recognize the type of flower. So now we will use deep learning knowledge to help botanist scientists to identify the type of flower. Let get started!

Step 1: Import the file we needed and load the Train dataset and Test datasets of Flowers using torchvision.
Step 2: Data augmentation & normalization.
Step 3: Count the flowers in datasets for each class.
Step 4: Plot a bar graph to for Training and Testing datasets of flowers in each class.
Step 5: Show the training images with label just for fun.
Step 6: Training the model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Step 7: Define a loss function and optimizer.
Step 8: Training network on Train dataset.
Step 9: Testing network on Test dataset.
Step 10: Show the predicted label of flowers.
Step 11: Show how the network perform on whole dataset(% value).
Step 12: Finally display the accuracy of each class of flowers.
Step 13: Plot a bar graph to show the accuracy v/s label of flowers.
